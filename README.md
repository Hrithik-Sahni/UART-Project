# UART-Project
Made a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter using Verilog(HDL)\
Used Xilinx ISE Design Suite for coding

### UART
A universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) is used for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable.
Requires only two wires for full duplex data transmission (apart from the power lines).

UART is being used in many applications like GPS Receivers, Bluetooth Modules, GSM and GPRS Modems, Wireless Communication Systems, RFID based applications etc.
